### VT-TV Dependencies

VT-TV depends on external librairies:
All dependencies must be placed in the current `lib` directory.

The `googletest`dependency is only required by the unit tests.
Note: to upgrade the GoogleTest library just edit the `fetch_googletest.sh` script and change the value of GTEST_BRANCHTAG to a valid tag name. Then execute the script.
